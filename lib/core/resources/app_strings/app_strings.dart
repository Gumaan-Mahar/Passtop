Using common passwords puts user accounts at a higher risk of being compromised.';

This practice is discouraged as it poses a security risk. If one account with a reused password is compromised, all other accounts with the same password become vulnerable. Attackers often target one account to gain access to multiple accounts using the same password. It is recommended to use unique passwords for each account or platform to maintain better security.';
